87	"Universal Dependencies is a project that seeks to develop cross-linguistically consistent treebank annotation for many languages, with the goal of facilitating multilingual parser development, cross-lingual learning, and parsing research from a language typology perspective. The annotation scheme is based on (universal) Stanford dependencies (de Marneffe et al., 2006, 2008, 2014), Google universal part-of-speech tags (Petrov et al., 2012), and the Interset interlingua for morphosyntactic tagsets (Zeman, 2008).

88	"Open linked data from the Hungarian National Museum. 
The following datasets and subsets are available:

* Collections (dataset, short  name: colls)
 * Bibliographic Data of the Central Library (subset, short name: colls-lib-bib)

The Bibliographic Data of the Central Library contains the entire online catalogue of the library in BIBFRAME format and provides links to external sources including: [BNF](http://data.bnf.fr), [ISNI](http://isni.org), [LC NAF](http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names.html), [VIAF](http:viaf.org) and [Wikidata](http://wikidata.org).

One of the aims of this publication is to make Hungarian librarians more familiar with BIBFRAME. In order to achieve this the BIBFRAME and the MARC descriptions are cross linked. Knowing the BIBFRAME URI of an instance:

[http://data.hnm.hu/id/colls/lib/bib/Instance/MNMKVT19563](http://data.hnm.hu/id/colls/lib/bib/Instance/MNMKVT19563)

one can get the MARC description by appending "".opac"" to the URI:

[http://data.hnm.hu/doc/colls/lib/bib/Instance/MNMKVT19563.opac](http://data.hnm.hu/doc/colls/lib/bib/Instance/MNMKVT19563.opac).

Knowing the permalink of an OPAC record 

[http://link.hnm.hu/lib/bib/MNMKVT19563](http://link.hnm.hu/lib/bib/MNMKVT19563)

one can get the BIBRAME description in HTML format by appending .rdf to it:

[http://link.hnm.hu/lib/bib/MNMKVT19563.rdf](http://link.hnm.hu/lib/bib/MNMKVT19563.rdf).

Other formats can also be invoked by appending the following extensions:
.rdf-ttl, .rdf-nt, .rdf-json, .rdf-jsonld, and .rdf-rdf. The .rdf-rdf extentsion gives back the rdf-xml format.

Clicking the BIBFRAME icon in the OPAC also leads to the BIBFRAME description.

The OPAC pages also support the link rel discovery service in order for the crawlers and other programs to find the RDF descriptions in different formats automatically.

The project was carried out in partnership with @Cult srl., Italy (MARC BIBFRAME conversion) and Monguz Ltd., Hungary (OPAC modification). We also used some parts of the ALIADA open source tool.

The @Cult MARC21 BIBFRAME conversion have the following main features:

- Work recognition
- Entity recognition
- Name entities are linked to external datasets.

The BIBFRAME dataset will be updated periodically as BIBFRAME and the conversion evolves. "	data-hnm-hu - Hungarian National Museum Datasets

96	This corpus consists of *sentiment* annotations of Amazon reviews for different product categories in the languages German and English. The reviews themselves are not part of this data publication. The annotations are fine-grained, including aspects and subjective phrases. In addition, the relation of an aspect to be a target of a subjective phrase is provided as well as the polarity of the subjective phrase. The corpus consists of 622 English and 611 German reviews for coffee machines, cutlery, microwaves, toaster, trash cans, vacuum cleaner, washing machines and dishwasher. The English corpus is annotated with more than 8000 aspects and 5000 subjective phrases, the German part with more than 6000 aspects and around 5000 subjective phrases (depending on the annotator). Each review is independently annotated by two annotators.	USAGE review corpus
